I've done several Exploratory analysis, mainly consisting of:
- check data types with df.dtypes
- check value counts of each column in order to find NaN/Unknown values/corrupted values
and accordingly adjusted them (e.g. filtered and used only LOCATIONs where number of Collisions
are higher than 10)
- use of plots such as bar charts for visualising counts of data distribution
- use of boxplot for detecting outliers of ROAD conditions
- use of pd.crosstab(normalize=True) for finding ratios between features
- use LabelEncoder for creation of correlation heatmap which helps to find
which features are interrelated (obviously WEATHER conditions are influencing ROAD conditions)

Machine learning algorithms used are for solving classification problems:
- DecisionTreeClassifier: Decision tree construction does not involve any domain knowledge or parameter setting, and therefore is appropriate for exploratory knowledge discovery.
Decision trees can handle multidimensional data. During tree construction, attribute selection measures are used to select the attribute that best partitions the tuples into distinct classes.
When decision trees are built, many of the branches may reflect noise or outliers in the training data. max_depth was set on 6.
Tree pruning attempts to identify and remove such branches, with the goal of improving classification accuracy on unseen data.
- Logistics regression: It can be used for Classification as well as for Regression problems, but mainly used for Classification problems.
In Logistic regression, it is not required to have the linear relationship between the dependent and independent variable. Logistic Regression uses Sigmoid function.

Data set was divided into training (0,7) and testing (0,3) set.
