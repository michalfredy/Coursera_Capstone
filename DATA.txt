DATA DESCRIPTION

I'm going to use data set provided in Week 1 about collisions in Seattle (Data-Collisions.csv) and after
checking the data there is a need to clean them and select main features used in
the further analysis. Cleaning of data mainly consists of:
- unification of values in columns (some used Y,N,1,0) - UNDERINFL
- binary codification of Y/N values into 1/0
- convert values in column to same data type (int)
- convert INCDATE from str into Date type
- drop NaN and empty rows in the selected features which we are going to use
- removed "Unknown" values from dataset


I dropped following columns because they are duplicated or irrelevant for my analysis:
- SEVERITYDESC (long text)
- SEVERITYCODE.1 (duplicate)
- SDOTCOLNUM (A number given to the collision by SDOT)
- EXCEPTRSNCODE
- ST_COLDESC (A detailed description of the severity of the collision)
- STATUS
- SPEEDING (only one value Category)
- INATTENTIONIND (only one value Category)
- PEDROWNOTGRNT (only one value Category)
- INCKEY
- COLDETKEY
- OBJECTID
- INCDTTM (similar to INCDATE but with concrete hours - missing hour attribute in 25% of rows)

I've selected following features (independent values) for prediction of dependent value SEVERITYCODE:
- ADDRTYPE: Collision address type
- LIGHTCOND: The light conditions during the collision.
- WEATHER: A description of the weather conditions during the time of the collision.
- ROADCOND: The condition of the road during the collision.


Numerical data (counts):
- PERSONCOUNT
- VEHCOUNT
- PEDCYLCOUNT

Numerical data (keys):
- SEGLANEKEY
- CROSSWALKKEY
- INTKEY

Space data (coordinates):
- X
- Y

By utilising independent values in machine learning models I will determine under
which conditions (WEATHER, ROADCOND, LIGHTCOND, JUNCTIONTYPE, etc.) it's most likely to
predict certain SEVERITYCODE in concrete places (SEGLANEKEY, CROSSWALKKEY, INTKEY)
